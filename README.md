# Subsurface Data Assessment
##### Data science assessment for subsurface data scientist/engineering candidates.

The assessment is designed to demonstrate your experience working with oil and gas data and building machine learning models with actual data.  As you are working through these tasks, think about how you would present and discuss the result.  You donâ€™t need to submit any code, the final product is a presentation that summarizes results and displays the visualization you created.  The presentation should guide us through what you did, any observations or ideas you had.  We may ask questions about your approach, the technology you used and insights you have.   

If you have any questions or need any clarification, please contact Brendon at <brendon.hall@petro.ai>.
